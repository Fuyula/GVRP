In addition to the routing plan, the amount of energy recharged and the technology used must also be determined. Constructive and local search heuristics are proposed, which are exploited within a non deterministic Simulated Annealing framework.

	abstract = {The Green Vehicle Routing Problem (G-{VRP}) aims to efficiently route a fleet of Alternative Fuel Vehicles, based at a common depot, in order to serve a set of customers, minimizing the total travel distance. Because of the limited driving range of these vehicles, intermediate stops at the Alternative Fuel Stations must also be considered. For the G-{VRP}, we propose two Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulations allowing multiple visits to the stations without introducing dummy copies of them. In the first model, only one visit to a station between two customers or between a customer and the depot is allowed. While, in the second model, two consecutive visits to stations are also permitted. In addition, the two formulations are strengthened through both dominance criteria to a priori identify the stations that are more efficient to use in each route and valid inequalities, specifically tailored for the G-{VRP}. Computational results, carried out on benchmark instances, show that our formulations strongly outperform the exact solution approaches presented in the literature. Finally, in order to better investigate the issue of the consecutive refueling stops, a new set of instances is properly generated and significant transport insights are also provided.},

The problem particularly arises for companies and agencies that employ a ﬂeet of alternative energy powered vehicles on transportation systems for urban areas or for goods distribution. Exact algorithm is based on the branchand-cut algorithm which combines several valid inequalities derived from the literature to improve lower bounds and introduces a heuristic algorithm based on simulated annealing to obtain upper bounds. Solution approach is evaluated in terms of the number of test instances solved to optimality, bound quality and computation time to reach the best solution of the various test problems. Computational results show that 22 of 40 instances with 20 customers can be solved optimally within reasonable computation time.},

We propose a simple yet effective two-phase heuristic to tackle the Green {VRP}. In the ﬁrst phase our heuristic builds a pool of routes via a set of randomized route-ﬁrst cluster-second heuristics with an optimal {AFSs} insertion procedure. In the second phase our approach assembles a Green {VRP} solution by solving a set partitioning formulation over the columns (routes) stored in the pool. To test our approach, we performed experiments on a set of 52 instances from the literature. The results show that our heuristic is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. Our heuristic unveiled 8 new best-known solutions, matched another 40, and delivered solutions with an average gap of 0.14\% for the 4 remaining instances.},

	abstract = {Recent decades have seen increasing utilization of optimization packages, based on Operations Research and Mathematical Programming techniques, for effective management of the provision of goods and services in distribution systems. Large numbers of real-world applications have widely shown that the use of computerized procedures for distribution process planning produces substantial savings (generally from 5\% to 20\%) in global transportation costs. The impact of these savings on the global economic system is signiﬁcant. The transportation process involves all stages of production and distribution systems and represents a relevant component (generally from 10\% to 20\%) of the ﬁnal cost of goods. The green vehicle routing problem ({GVRP}) is an emerging research ﬁeld that attracts many researchers. This survey paper aims to classify and review the literature on {GVRPs} from various perspectives. This paper covers publications between 2006 and 2019 including 309 papers. To this end, a systematic literature review has been implemented in order to respond to corresponding questions related to this area. This study proposes an extensive structure compromising various aspects including variants of {GVRPs}, objective functions, uncertainty, and solutions approach to analyze {GVRPs} studies from different perspectives. Some new research areas have been drawn based on problem classiﬁcation, uncertainties, solution methodologies, and ﬁnally, the objective function approaches for future research directions. The results of this study show that researches on {GVRPs} are relatively fresh and there is still room for large improvements in several areas.},

As an NP-hard problem, this problem is very diﬃcult to solve. In this paper, we ﬁrst propose a memetic algorithm (MA)—a population-based algorithm—to tackle this problem. To be more speciﬁc, we incorporate an adaptive local search procedure based on a reward and punishment mechanism inspired by reinforcement learning to eﬀectively manage the multiple neighborhood moves and guide the search, an eﬀective backbone-based crossover operator to generate the feasible child solutions to obtain a better trade-oﬀ between intensiﬁcation and diversiﬁcation of the search, and a longest common subsequence-based population updating strategy to eﬀectively manage the population. The purpose of this research is to propose a highly eﬀective heuristic for solving the green vehicle routing problem and bring new ideas for this type of problem. Experimental results show that our algorithm is highly eﬀective in comparison with the current state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, our algorithm is able to ﬁnd the best solutions for 84 out of the 92 instances. Key component of the approach is analyzed to evaluate its impact on the proposed algorithm and to identify the appropriate search mechanism for this type of problem.},

Therefore, during their distribution process, AFVs are required to visit alternative fuel stations (AFSs) for refueling. The design of the vehicle routes for AFVs becomes difficult due to the limited loading capacity, the low fuel tank capacity and the scarce availability of AFSs. Two solution methods, the two-phase heuristic algorithm and the meta-heuristic based on ant colony system, are proposed to solve the problem.

	abstract = {Cross-docking distribution is becoming increasingly prevalent in supply chain management (SCM) due to the replacement of storage and order-picking with efficient product consolidation. Several successful cross-docking applications have been put into practice by companies such as Wal-Mart, FedEx, and Home Depot. Cross-docking consists of interrelated operations which require proper synchronization. Only a few early attempts have addressed the vehicle routing problem in this context. Moreover, the social consciousness of sustainable development has brought up the issue of green SCM which is not only environment-friendly but also beneficial to business values. This paper first addresses a previously studied problem and then proposes a new problem version for planning the least cost green vehicle routing in which the deployed vehicles transport the final products from suppliers to customers through a cross-dock subject to a CO2 intensity constraint. We develop an adaptive memory artificial bee colony (AMABC) algorithm to tackle both problems. Compared to a Tabu search proposed in the literature, the AMABC algorithm can reach higher fuel efficiency by managing the loading along the route and yield less cost and CO2 intensities. Statistical tests of simulation and geographic data show that the AMABC method is robust against the problem size and convergence of the objective value is guaranteed with high confidence.},

	abstract = {With the growing public awareness of global warming, green supply chain management has received much attention. In particular, reducing the fuel consumption of trucks has been the topic of interest for both transportation providers (carriers) and manufacturing companies (shippers) over many years. As a way to reduce trucks’ fuel burn, attention has been given lately to the development of a decision model (problem) that is designed to solve a variant of the standard vehicle routing problem, called the pollution routing problem (PRP), which minimizes the fuel burn or pollutants emission of trucks. While useful in many respects, existing PRP models require many inputs from the users, making it inconvenient to utilize them in the field. In this paper we consider the PRP from the users’ viewpoint. We first identify, by reviewing the PRP literature and obtaining expert opinions from carrier managers, a practical PRP model that uses only a subset of the inputs required by other PRPs, and then develop an effective solution technique for this model. Based on the theoretical finding that the proposed PRP, which is a single-objective optimization problem, can be re-formulated as a dual-objective optimization problem, we develop a solution technique that utilizes the concept of efficient frontier to identify and search the most promising area of the solution space. Computational testing conducted with standard instances taken from the literature demonstrates the potential of the proposed approach.},
